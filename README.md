# Starterpack

My starterpack for SA2

[deployed url](https://nitya-starter-pack.onrender.com/)

## What Worked Well
Using npm to add dependencies

## What Didn't
It wouldn't work without moving eslint to dependencies and not just dev dependencies. Also had to update the node version on render to use the favicon plugin but once I figured that out, it was fun!

## Extra Credit
Added a favicon plugin!
